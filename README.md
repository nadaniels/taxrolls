# Tax Rolls of Medieval Paris
Welcome to the Tax Rolls of Medieval Paris project.  

A styled html version of the protype is available at: [https://nadaniels.github.io/taxrolls/TaxRoll_1313_HTML.html](https://nadaniels.github.io/taxrolls/TaxRoll_1313_HTML.html)

The prototype currently consists of the following files:
* `TaxRoll_1313_TEI.xml` - The marked up TEI/XML file for a small portion of the 1313 Parisian Tax Roll
* `TaxRoll_1313_TEI.html` - A rendered HTML version of the marked up TEI file. A handful of analytics are found at the bottom of the file
* `TaxRoll_Transform.xsl` - An XSL Transformation file that converts the TEI/XML version of the Tax Roll into HTML
* `TaxRoll_Style.css` - A CSS file used to render the HTML
